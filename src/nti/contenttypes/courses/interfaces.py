Course-related interfaces.

Most course-related objects are also folders containing
subobjects, and they are also :class:`.IPossibleSite` objects
for local policy containment (including things like default
preferences). The expected contents of each type of object
are explained on the object itself.

# Notes:
#
# How to determine available courses?
#  -- Could either enumerate, or we maintain
#     a Catalog (probably a catalog long term)
#
# How to tell what a user is enrolled in?
#  -- We could also use a catalog here,
#     but enrollment status effects permissioning,
#     not just of UGD (which previously was handled
#     implicitly through sharing things with a specific
#     DFL) but also of content. That means that
#     means ACLs and "effective principals" get involved.
#     This could still be done with a DFL 'owned' by the
#     CourseInstance object, but a hierarchy can be extremely
#     useful (e.g., all students, ou students, ou grad students).
#     A hierarchy is offered by IPrincipal/IGroup and the
#     use of zope.pluggableauth.plugins.groupfolder,
#     so that's probably what we'll go with.
#
#     The remaining question is where the groupfolders live. pluggableauth
#     uses IAuthentication utilities, which are usually persistent
#     and which become active through traversal. If the groupfolder
#     is local to each ICourseInstance's SiteManager, this is handy
#     for permissioning and local editing, but not for global
#     queries. I really like the idea of local groupfolders,
#     so we may punt on that for now and do some sort of a
#     (cached) global enumeration when necessary until we
#     either do a catalog or manually keep a second datastructure.
